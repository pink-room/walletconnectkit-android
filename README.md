# WalletConnectKit

`WalletConnectKit` is the Swiss Army toolkit for `WalletConnect`. It will allow you to connect your
DApp with a Wallet in a few minutes and start performing method calls right away.

> **Note**
> This SDK uses the WalletConnect v2 protocol and it's currently in the Alpha version. Right now, we
> only support the Sign protocol but aim to add more protocols in the future. Contributions are
> welcome! ðŸš€
